## üìÄ Installation

Installation instructions are broken into sections for _operational_ and _development_ installations.


### Operational

For operational installation of LDDTool, see the deployed documentation for installation instructions: https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds4-information-model/model-lddtool/install/index.html


### Development
For development installation, use maven:

```console
$ # Package the software
$ mvn clean package

$ # Generate the site (must run package first)
$ mvn site:site site:stage

$ # To view generated docs
$ open target/staging/model/index.html
```

To update the site documentation, see each components `src/site` directory (this is common for all Java Maven software):
| Component | Site Directory | Online Documentation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Top-level Page | `src/site` | https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds4-information-model/ |
| LDDTool | `model-lddtool/src/site` | https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds4-information-model/model-lddtool/ |
| DMDocument | `model-dmdocument/src/site` | https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds4-information-model/model-dmdocument/ |
| Ontology | `model-ontology/src/site` | https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds4-information-model/model-ontology/ |
